									<h1>Assessment</h1>
									<p>Our group has determined the effectiveness of our solution to the problem we have chosen.</p>
								</header>
                                <h2>Effectiveness</h2>
								<p> Our proposed solution, aimed at enhancing healthcare services and accessibility to these services to improve overall community well-being, aligns with a longstanding effort to make healthcare more accessible for the general populace.</p> 

<p> Based on articles you can find in the sources below, this initiative has the possibility of garnering widespread positive reception, however people become more conflicted and their support dissipates once actual changes to the system are made.</p>

<p> The effectiveness of this solution largely depends on support from policymakers, government institutions and political support from the general public.</p>
                                <h2>Data</h2>
                                <h3>Academic Journals and Publications:</h3>
                                <p>Explore academic databases such as PubMed, JSTOR, or ScienceDirect for peer-reviewed articles. Look for studies that specifically address the impact of healthcare access improvement on gender-related health disparities.</p> 

    <h3>World Health Organization (WHO) Reports:</h3>
    <p>The World Health Organization often publishes reports and studies related to global health issues, including gender disparities in healthcare. Check their official website for comprehensive and reliable information.</p>

<h3>Government Health Agencies:</h3>
<p>National health agencies often conduct research on healthcare access and its impact on different demographics. Look for reports from agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
